# High-Current-Control-Systems

The first system is design a H-Bridge(L293D) with mosfot transistors.
In this system N-Channel and P-Channel IRF540 mosfet transistors were used as this type is commonly used with Arduino, due to its low threshold current, as well as it can be used with the other types of microcontrollers.
Also, it has continuous Drain Current (ID) equal to 33A at 25Â°C, pulsed Drain Current (ID-peak) equal to 110A and maximum Drain Source Voltage (VDS) equal to 100V.
